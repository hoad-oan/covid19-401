# Estimated Population in 2020 --------------------------------------------

# Original dataset from

#Created an excel sheet with only the data from 2020 population

# Other comments ----------------------------------------------------------

# To make sure the month and state data matches between different datasets, I edited the state names so if they
#were in abbreviations, they would appear in full name, and the months will be formatted to Month-2020 in Excel.
