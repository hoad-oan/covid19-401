# The COVID-19 Pandemic: Role of Restrictions and Impact on Social Factors

This is ISA401 final visualization project, started by looking at the data collected about COVID-19 cases and went further to identify how the dynamics of the economy and social welfare have shifted since the case of COVID-19 was identified in the U.S. in January of 2020. Data was aggregated from a diverse range of sources. COVID-19 data relating to identified cases, deaths, and hospitalization over the year by state. From there, different indicators of the economy and the welfare of U.S. residents were identified, such as unemployment rates, SNAP benefits, GDP indicators. Since most of this data is published by government or academic institutions and used for existing reporting, their sources are easily verified, ELT processes were needed to aggregate and sync different datasets for visualizations. The primary method utilized employed R Studio, Excel, and Tableau to clean, aggregate, and create visualizations for the data collected. They were then merged in Tableau to create final visualization.
